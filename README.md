# rust-bevy and the Nature of Code

The book **The Nature of Code** from **Daniel Shiffman** is a wonderful book about programming.

About many things you need to know when programing games.

My personal challenge is to make an example for every chapter in **Rust** with **Bevy** (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)

Thanks to https://github.com/iMplode-nZ/bevy-orbit-controls. Many lines of the module **orbitcamera.rs** are from that.
